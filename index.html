<h2>The Problem Congo Addresses</h2>
<p>Linkedin and Facebook all make it great to grow your number of "connections" and "followers" as a vanity metric.
However, if you ask anyone about what value their LinkedIn Connections create, they usually don't know.  This is because these platforms all allow tons of people to form meaningless connections.
They do not allow you to recall how or why you know someone.  Without this info, how is one to create value from them?

<h3>Congo's Value Prop  
</h3>
<p>Congo, short for Connect and GO, solves this problem by automatically recording why and how you know everyone you add to your network.
Most valuable business connections start at some form of event, so Congo includes an easy to use event build and discover platform.
It then seemlessly integrates into an easy to use visual contact book that enables you to find who you need in your network, at a time appropriate to find them.
Congo helps remove the randomness from networking and needless unsolicited contacts.
